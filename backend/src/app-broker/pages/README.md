These are standalone pages - that have the ability to
be skinned / configured at the server end.

Basically we want to have a plausible nice login etc page - but really don't
want it to be a big deal _within_ our project (that is, we really
don't want to have to install React or Vuejs).

We have dipped into some jQuery where needed - via CDN.

It uses Bootstrap 5 via CDN.

Neither are choices we would make for anything other than a
demonstration system.
